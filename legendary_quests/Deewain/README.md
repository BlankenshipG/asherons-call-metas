Info:
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- Auto loots legendary chest at the end using currently loaded loot profile
- Uses Colosseum Recall to throw away junk at the end, if a character doesn't have it, will halt at reward NPC
- If anyone dies during boss fight, group attempts to wait for them and will kill boss again if needed
- Uses /ub bc, which can impact multiple fellows/groups if running an army
- If anyone is already flagged for boss, they wait outside until the group reaches boss
- Can be completed with just one character in a fellow with an egg, but Deewain (Iron Golem) might send you to the lifestone with Shock Bomb.  You've been warned. :)

How this meta can get stuck/broken:
- Disconnect of any fellowship member
- If the leader's client glitches and views others as being distant when they are not
- Lag while navigating the portal maze
- Bad timing with Dewaine defender golems and doors closing at awkward times
- Death of any fellowship member before getting to boss
- Mage/Missile characters are used to clear rocks on bridge, so if the fellow is of only melees it will get stuck

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn with a fellow of 4
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Averoth for the many navroutes to get through the starting random maze and the portal maze, they are borrowed from his Deewain meta
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
