Info:
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- Auto loots legendary chest at the end using current loot profile
- This quest includes a custom loot profile for the quest item, at the end of the quest a loot profile of "DefaultLoot.utl" is loaded
Be aware of needing to change this back to your preferred profile afterwards (or rename/copy your profile to be named DefaultLoot.utl)

How this meta can get stuck/broken:
- Death/Disconnect
- If doing solo, need to kill a Falatacot for last parchment.  This requires being fairly well equipped, although this quest is one fo the easiest legendary quests.

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
