Rynthid Foundry Fellow V1   
Completes Rynthid Foundry quest as a multi-client fellowship     

Steps to run:
- Copy files (.met and .utl) into Virindi Tank directory, usually C:\Games\VirindiPlugins\VirindiTank
- Create fellowship with all characters going on quest
- Type the following in chat: /ub bc /vt meta load RynthidFoundryFellowV1

Requirements:
- Virindi Tank
- Utility Belt (0.2.7)
- Characters completing quest must be in a fellowship, everyone in fellow must complete quest
- One character must have an Egg in their inventory and are designated as the leader
- Must have Rynthid recall

Info:
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- Uses /ub bc, which can impact multiple fellows/groups if running an army
- This meta uses dispel gems liberally if you have them.  This improves survivability as the Rynthid mobs are dangerous
- This quest is not good.

How this meta can get stuck/broken:
- Death/Disconnect of any fellowship member
- If the leader's client glitches and views others as being distant when they are not when grouping before the platforms
- The jump on the Rynthid platforms to reach the dungeon can sometimes be a problem depending on mobs/respawn
- This quest hands in 3 items to 3 different ore repositories in the dungeon.  This can sometimes get interrupted by mobs.  A future improvement to this meta would be to have better error handling for this.

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn with a fellow of 4
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
