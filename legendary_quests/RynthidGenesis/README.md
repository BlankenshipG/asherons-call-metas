Info:
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- Uses /ub bc, which can impact multiple fellows/groups if running an army
- This meta uses dispel gems liberally if you have them (and you should!).  This improves survivability as the Rynthid mobs are dangerous with their ring spells when vuln'd.  50+ dispel gems per character are recommended.  Even with dispel gems, a lightning vuln followed by a ring spell that hits twice can and will kill characters sometimes.  
- This quest is long.  About 1 hour to complete.
- It is recommended to monitor this meta as it runs, as the jump on the Rynthid platforms, and the doorways in the Path of Rage/Torment dungeons can cause characters to get stuck sometimes.
- Rynthid area requires that your group is fairly well equipped.
- In the final dungeon, the meta visits all 3 rooms where the Corrupt Bulwark can spawn.  Maybe someday it could be more sophisticated in detecting that the Bulwark has been found and killed.  Currently it clears all 3 rooms to ensure the door opens.


How this meta can get stuck/broken:
- Death/Disconnect of any fellowship member
- If the leader's client glitches and views others as being distant when they are not when grouping before the platforms
- The jump on the Rynthid platforms to reach the dungeon can sometimes be a problem depending on mobs/respawn
- The doorways in the Path of Rage and Path of Torment can cause characters to sometimes get stuck.
- There are several big battles on this quest on the platforms and in the final dungeon.  Must be well equipped or will likely die.

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn with a fellow of 4
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
