Requirements:
- Virindi Tank
- Utility Belt (0.2.7)

Info:
- The fellowship leader is the only one who runs into the "snowball" room to pull the lever
- The fellowship navigates independently in this meta.  Too much getting stuck when trying to follow a leader.
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- Auto loots legendary chest at the end using currently loaded loot profile
- Uses /ub bc, which can impact multiple fellows/groups if running an army
- Can be completed with just one character in a fellow with an egg
- This quest includes a custom loot profile to loot keys, at the end of the quest a loot profile of "DefaultLoot.utl" is loaded
Be aware of needing to change this back to your preferred profile afterwards (or rename/copy your profile to be named DefaultLoot.utl)

How this meta can get stuck/broken:
- Disconnect of any fellowship member before getting to the dungeon
- If the leader's client glitches and views others as being distant when they are not

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn with a fellow of 4
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
