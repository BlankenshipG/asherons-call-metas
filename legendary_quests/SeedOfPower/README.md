Completes Seed of Power quest as a fellowship 

Steps to run:
- Copy files (.met and .utl) into Virindi Tank directory, usually C:\Games\VirindiPlugins\VirindiTank
- Create fellowship with all characters going on quest
- Type the following in chat: /ub bc /vt meta load SeedOfPowerFellowV1

Requirements:
- Virindi Tank
- Utility Belt (0.2.7)
- Must have Rynthid recall

Video: 

Info:
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- This meta uses dispel gems liberally if you have them. 
- Uses /ub bc which can impact clients other than those in the current fellowship if running an army
- This meta is not automatic due to the lightning floor maze at the end of the final dungeon.  This maze must be done manually as there is currently no way to consistently have the meta move within the floor paths without getting portaled.  If you leave the meta running, it will automatically take over again once the floor maze has been cleared.
- This meta has some handling for death, as getting into each of the dungeons for this quest is in a Rynthid (hot) area.


How this meta can get stuck/broken:

- Tested on LeafDawn
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
