Info:
- Expects Monster tab of Virindi Tank to be configured for quest mobs
- Auto loots legendary chest at the end using currently loaded loot profile
- Does not collect optional "book" item in dungeon for additional luminance

How this meta can get stuck/broken:
- Death or Disconnect
- If the leader's client glitches and views others as being distant when they are not
- There are 2 jumps inside the dungeon.  Missing either one somehow will likely lead to a stuck character.  Jumps have been tested, but lag or mobs can occasionally cause an issue

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn with a fellow of 4
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
