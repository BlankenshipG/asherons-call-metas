Info:
- Daimyo Idah only spawns at night and only has a 20% chance of spawning.  80% of the time a Spectral Minion spawns instead.
- The meta will wait until night to begin checking for Idah if it is day.
- This meta relies on landblock resets to force Idah to spawn.  If the landblock is occupied by other players, then the meta will have almost no chance of finding Idah.  In this case, Idah will only spawn if you manually kill the Spectral Minion where Idah spawns and then wait for respawn.
- If Idah is found, the meta will report this and do nothing.  This meta does not handle fighting and looting Idah.  

How this meta can get stuck/broken:

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
