Gauntlet Lum Gems V1

Note: A character needs only 1 of each per Gauntlet run.  5 are purchased for convenience.

Info:
- Checks that the player has 125K luminance when starting, if not, will stop
- Picking up the luminance tokens can be a little tricky, give the meta time to try and retry 
- Can be run by many clients at once, just will take longer as there is only one token that spawns at a time
- The full names of the gems are Luminous Crystal of Vitality, Luminous Crystal of Rare Armor Damage Boost V, and Luminous Crystal of Rare Damage Reduction V
