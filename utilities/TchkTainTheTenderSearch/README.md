Info:
- Iron Blade Overseer has 2 possible spawn locations, one during day and one during night.  The meta visits the one corresponding to the current time.
- If found, the meta will kill TchkTain and loot the head.  The meta loads a custom loot profile to do this.
- This meta loops forever and will continue searching for TchkTain.  This can be useful for ensuring an entire fellowship gets the item.
