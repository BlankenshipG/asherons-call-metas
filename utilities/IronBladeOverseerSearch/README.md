Info:
- Iron Blade Overseer has 3 possible spawn locations, each with a 4% chance of spawn.
- This meta visits each of the locations, killing mobs along the way
- If found, the meta will kill the Overseer use the NPC that spawns to get the corresponding item.
- This meta loops forever and will continue searching for the Overseer.  This can be useful for ensuring an entire fellowship gets the item.
- This meta primarily uses landblock resets to force the Overseer to spawn.  However, if the Gearknight area is occupied by another player, it still has a chance to find the Overseer since mobs are killed while searching.
