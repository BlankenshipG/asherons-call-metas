Info:
- Brew Kettle can be given, so this quest can be completed by any character, not just a Cooking Character
- Has some jumps, these were tested with characters with max jump, so might need some assistance for a level 150-200 character
- This especially applies to the last dungeon where you have to jump on small pedestal to get item
