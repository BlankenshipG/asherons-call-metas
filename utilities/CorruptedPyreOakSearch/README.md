Info:
- Corrupted Pyre Oak only spawns at night.  If it is not night, the meta will wait until night to continue checking
- When found, the meta does nothing and stops.  Note that the Oak will disappear when night becomes day again if not killed
- If Graveyard has other players in it, this meta will not work, as the landblock will not reset unless empty

- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
