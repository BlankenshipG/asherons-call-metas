Info:
- Daimyo Nobanuga only spawns during the day and only has a 20% chance of spawning.  80% of the time a Spectral Minion spawns instead.
- The meta will wait until day to begin checking for Nobanuga if it is night.
- This meta relies on landblock resets to force Nobanuga to spawn.  If the landblock is occupied by other players, then the meta will have almost no chance of finding Nobanuga.  In this case, Noganuga will only spawn if you manually kill the Spectral Minion where Nobanuga spawns and then wait for respawn.
- If Nobanuga is found, the meta will report this and do nothing.  This meta does not handle fighting and looting Nobanuga.  

How this meta can get stuck/broken:

Other:
- Tested on LeafDawn
- Tested only on ACEmulator.  May or may not work on GDLE.
- Thanks to Eskarina for making metas editable as text files.   This meta would not exist otherwise.
