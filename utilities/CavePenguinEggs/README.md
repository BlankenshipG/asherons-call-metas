Info:
- Recommended character level is around 100
- Can be run at the same time by multiple characters/accounts, a fun side game to see who gets done first
- This quest includes a custom loot profile to loot the eggs, at the end of the quest a loot profile of "DefaultLoot.utl" is loaded
- Be aware of needing to change this back to your preferred profile afterwards (or rename/copy your profile to be named DefaultLoot.utl)

How this meta can get stuck/broken:
